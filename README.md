# NLipsum : Lorem Ipsum (Lipsum) Generator and Library for .NET Core 6.0+ (C#)

This project is a fork of Alex C Pendleton's NLipsum (see: https://github.com/alexcpendleton/NLipsum)

Similar to the Python Lipsum, you are not bound to generate only "Lorem ipsum..." style text. There are a dozen different text-generation sources in several languages, all of which come from the Python Lipsum. You can also easily include your own text source!

The built in text sources:

- Lorem Ipsum (Lipsum) (of course)
- Childe Harold's Pilgrimage (Lord Byron)
- Decameron - Novella Prima (Giovanni Boccaccio)
- Faust (Goethe), German
- In der Fremde (Heinrich Heine), German
- Le Bateau Ivre (Arthur Rimbaud), French
- Le Masque (Charles Baudelaire), French
- Nagyon fáj (József Attila), Hungarian
- Ómagyar-Mária siralom (Ismeretlen), Hungarian
- Robinsono Kruso (Daniel Defoe), Esperanto
- The Raven (Edward Allen Poe), English
- Tierra y Luna (Federico García Lorca), Spanish

NLipsum will choose a random selection of words from your text source and combine them into sentences and combine those sentences into paragraphs. You can request very specific criteria for your generated text or just let the defaults go to work. Generating text in HTML format is a breeze and there are built-in utility methods for HTML generation (paragraph tags).

## Meta
This is not a very active project. I'll continue to accept pull requests for version support, and reasonable bugs and changes. However, there are no planned features, and no plans for major changes. I don't have much of a personal use for Lipsum these days, so if you're really hankering for updates, tell me about it!

Please feel free to send me any feedback or tell me about a project in which you've used NLipsum. I'd love to hear about it.
